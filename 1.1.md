## 1.1 The Form of Addressing

* How to call people？
>|        | Western Society  |China|
>|  ----  | ---------------  |---- |
>| Call people  | First name(Mr.Ms.Dr.professor)|Respecting people(Elder.Higher-ranked.More experienced)|
<br/>

* Ask for the way(Guess the age of that person and compare it with your own)
>+ If they are about the **age of your father** . (“uncle”or”aunt” are not bad choices)<br/>
>+ If they are about the **age of your grandfather**. (address them in a similar way)

<br/>

* For senior people(at the retiring age) in China
>1. they don’t mind being called "grandpa" or "grandma"<br/>
>2. it is a way to show :
>>+ rich life experiences <br/>
>>+ good manners<br/>
>>+ being respected<br/>
>>+ taken good care of by the whole society

<br/>

* If a man is aware of looking after his parents and obey the order of his superior or authority
>1. He would not violate the law<br/>
>2. Not make troubles for his work colleagues or offend his supervisors

<br/>


* When people try to address others, they tend to use honorific words.
>1. Distinguished or honorable you, would you afford some of your precious time to join our meeting…?<br/>
>2. What is your honorable surname?<br/>
>3. How’s your beloved father?

<br/>


* When people try to describe themselves, they tend to use those words with modesty meanings:

>1. Thank you very much for the invitation, I, the humble one, would love to have this honor to join you.<br/>
>2. Without any special ranks or class, my name is…<br/>
>3. My father at home is all right.

<br/>

>+ Chinese people put their priority on others rather than oneself to make people feel comfortable and establish a rapport  **before formal conversations**.  

<br/>


* Ranks or age
>1. If we meet people at the same age	（"Elder brother","Elder sister"）<br/>
>2. If they are father's generation	（BOBO (Father's elder brother)，not ~~Shushu (Father's younger brother)~~）

<br>

* In the work place,we'd rather call people by their ranks than by their jobs.
>+ Professor zhang  ~~Teacher Zhang~~ <br>
>+ Manager Lee ~~Accountant Lee~~<br>
>+ Chairman Song ~~Engineer Song~~

<br>

* Western people are more flexible in calling each other,There are 4 ways of addressing people.
>+ First, general address :	Sir,Madam,Ladies and Gentleman.<br>
>+ Second, address people by their jobs :	Dr. Brown,Professor Williams，Prince Charles,Judge Rooney, Senator Harley...<br>
>+ Third, by their first names :As you know, this becomes more and more common in modern society.<br>
>+ Fourth, by family relationships: Uncle James, Aunt Susie.

<br>

* Western adorable addressing(buildup a closer relationship)
> only used in very informal occasions.
>+ "Sweetheart"
>+ "Love"
>+ "Lad"
>+ "Chap"

<br>

* There are similarities in Chinese and Western way of addressing people.As a part of social communication.
>1. Addressing is used as a very important way to **establish**, **maintain** and even **strengthen** people's relationships.<br>
>2. People's **jobs**, **positions**, **social status**,**age** and **generations** are all considerations in the form of addressing.

<br>

* Chinese people use more respectful words with others:
>Really difficult for people to find any equivalence to English.<br>
>Some of those words are not even heard in oral English for being too formal or complicated:
>+ Your beloved father<br>
>+ Honorable you<br>

<br>

* Some words even contain different connotation meanings when they are used to address people.
>+ "Sir" any male<br>
>+ "Sir" well-informed scholar<br>
>+ Add a first name after"Uncle"or"Aunt".Indicate the close ties between two people.<br>
>+ Chinese usually just call"Uncle"or"Aunt". Calling first names is considered rather rude.<br>
>+ If Chinese people)call people with no blood relationship. Add only a surname.

<br>

* Summarize
>1. Chinese young people are **converging** into world culture.<br>
>2. Chinese people still use **traditional** ways to address others.<br>
>3. This reflects the vigorous **vitality** of Chinese ancient philosophy.<br>
>4. It also demonstrates the strong communication function of addressing can never diminish.
