* Introduction
>+ The words or actions of **communicating** through a third party.<br/>
>+ Originally meant a way of **passing on** words in ancient etiquette.<br/>
>+ The more respectable the status,the farther the distance, and the more **intermediary** was set up between them.
>>+ “Introduction and Passing on"<br/>
>> 1. The word“introduction” partly means to **continue** and **inherit**.<br/>
>> 2. Should call the other's courtesy name.<br/>
>> 3. To show **humbleness** and **politeness**.<br/>

<br>

* There are a lot of Chinese saying to indicate the importance of courtesy and etiquette :
>+ “Courtesy is never to blame.”礼多人不怪。
>+ “Gifts come as compliments if guests cannot come.”人不到礼到。
>+ “Better to obey than to respect.”恭敬不如从命。

* There is a list of people for you to introduce, how will you decide who should be introduced first?
>+ ages<br/>
>+ Positions<br/>
>+ Ranks<br/>

>+ a teacher & **a student**
>+ **a gentleman** & a lady
>+ **a guest** & the host
